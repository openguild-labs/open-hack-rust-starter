- Step 3: `Clone` the forked repository to your local device using the below command

```
git clone https://github.com/[name-of-your-account]/open-hack-rust-starter.git
```

Replace the `[name-of-your-account]` with your Github username. For example, if my username is `chungquantin`, I would do the below command to clone the repository to my local device.

```
git clone https://github.com/chungquantin/open-hack-rust-starter.git
```

- Step 4: Edit the `README.md` file to register for official participation

Go to **Participant Registration** section and register to be the workshop participants. Add the below to the list, replace any placeholder with your personal information.

```
| ü¶Ä    | Your Name | Your Github username | Your current occupation |
```

- Step 5: `Commit` your code and push to the forked Github repository

```
git add .
git commit -m "Register for OpenHack workshop"


- Step 6: Create a `Pull Request` to merge your changes to this repository and name your PR as `Your name | Register for OpenHack workshop`

## Mission 2: Install and setup Rust on your local device

The first step is to install Rust. We‚Äôll download Rust through `rustup`, a
command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. You‚Äôll need
an internet connection for the download.

> Note: If you prefer not to use `rustup` for some reason, please see the
> [Other Rust Installation Methods page][otherinstall] for more options.

The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.

### Installing `rustup` on Linux or macOS

If you‚Äôre using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```console
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the `rustup`
tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted
for your password. If the install is successful, the following line will appear:

```text
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

You will also need a _linker_, which is a program that Rust uses to join its
compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get
linker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a
linker. A C compiler is also useful because some common Rust packages depend on
C code and will need a C compiler.

On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running:

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```

Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their
distribution‚Äôs documentation. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install
the `build-essential` package.

### Installing `rustup` on Windows

On Windows, go to [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install][install] and follow
the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you‚Äôll
be prompted to install Visual Studio. This provides a linker and the native
libraries needed to compile programs. If you need more help with this step, see
[https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html][msvc]

### Troubleshooting

To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this
line:

```console
$ rustc --version
```

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest
stable version that has been released, in the following format:

```text
rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
```

If you see this information, you have installed Rust successfully! If you don‚Äôt
see this information, check that Rust is in your `%PATH%` system variable as
follows.

In Windows CMD, use:

```console
> echo %PATH%
```

In PowerShell, use:

```powershell
> echo $env:Path
```

In Linux and macOS, use:

```console
$ echo $PATH
```

If that‚Äôs all correct and Rust still isn‚Äôt working, there are a number of
places you can get help. Find out how to get in touch with other Rustaceans (a
silly nickname we call ourselves) on [the community page][community].

### Updating and Uninstalling

Once Rust is installed via `rustup`, updating to a newly released version is
easy. From your shell, run the following update script:

```console
$ rustup update
```

To uninstall Rust and `rustup`, run the following uninstall script from your
shell:

```console
$ rustup self uninstall
```
